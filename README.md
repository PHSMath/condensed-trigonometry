Condensed Trigonometry
======================


Foreward

My original plan was to publish and sell Condensed Trigonometry in mid 2014.  Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to deal with traditional publishing.  So, in an effort to have the book make some impact, I've decided to release it under the Creative Commons license.  Under this license, others may read, modify, and redistribute the full text and LaTeX source code it as they see fit.

If you look today, you'll often find trigonometry textbooks that cost $100 or more.  That's quite a premium for a 2000 year old idea!  I hope you find this to be an acceptable alternative, and if not, let me know!  Constructive criticism is welcome, and I'll keep working to improve the text and regularly release updates.

Building
------

A pre-generated copy of the book is available directly in the repository, the file condensed_trigonometry.pdf.  To assemble the book, you'll need Make and PDFLatex installed.  Run make, and condensed_trigonometry.pdf will be updated.  That's it!
